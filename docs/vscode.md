## What is this?

The current README is designed for development directly inside a running container. This causes issues when the codebase is introduced with lines of code that the running container is unable to compile. You will be stuck in a loop of wanting to fix some code to get the project to compile, whilst being dependent on a working container to develop.

Instead, I propose a local development environment independent from Docker.

> Attaching directly to the container is still useful when you want to utilise the debug server.

## Files explained

Which folders and files are relevant to VScode, what do they mean, and which ones are recognised by VSCode.

- `.vscode/`  
  Folder recognized by VSCode. Contains configurations for workspace.

- `extensions.json`  
  Contains common extensions needed for this project.
  This file is recognised by VSCode, so hopefully it prompts you to install these automatically.

- `extensions.json.recommended`  
  Contains recommended optional extensions for this project.

- `launch.json`  
  Contains configurations for debugging.

- `settings.json`  
  Contains workspace settings for VSCode and extensions. Note that workspace settings takes precedens over user-settings.
  This file is recognised by VSCode and is to be configured to your liking. That's why this file is intentionally excluded from git.

- `settings.json.default`  
  Contains common project-specific settings shared between developers. These settings are project specific and intended to be used ba all team-members. Copy these settings into `settings.json`.

- `settings.json.suggestions`  
  Contains suggestions for useful settings, but not neccessary ones. Copy into `settings.json` if desired.
