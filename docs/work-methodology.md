## Work methodology
### Scrum and Kanban mix

Description of how we work with our GitLab board and the columns meaning.

### `Open:`

Newly created, unrefined, unsettled or missing task labels. These tasks generally speaking might need a better description so the team can understand its contents and decide if it should be moved to backlog, deleted or need clarification of sorts.

### `Backlog:`

Tasks that the team have decided on without any sort of prioritization as of yet. They are either broken down and refined or include enough data to be refined. 

Mandatory use of label tags, all tasks in backlog must have labels attached. We use labels to easily know what a task is about and for searching/filtering tasks in priority meetings.

### `Accepted:`

Prioritized and refined tasks that the team have decide to finalize in the nearest future.

We move tasks from Backlog -> Accepted in our priority meetings.

### `In progress:`

Tasks that are in development.

### `Review:`

Tasks in need of review.

### `Done:`

Finalized and merged tasks. We go over this column in our weekly status meeting with product owner and move them from Done -> Closed.

## Ceremonies

### `Priority meeeting:`
Purpose, consenus about what work needs to be done. Set up the team for success through prioritization. Move tasks from Backlog -> Accepted.

### `Status meeeting:`

Go over the Done column with product owner. Look at the status of epics in roadmap/milestones. Any needed clarification, we have our shared onenote in kundeportal teams channel for inquiries.
